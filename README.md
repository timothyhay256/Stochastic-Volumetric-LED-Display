*Hello those from Open Sauce!*

This project allows you to scan a container full of individually addressible RGB leds, and create a representation of those LEDs in 3d space in Unity/Houdini, where you can apply whatever effects in 3d that you desire.  
It also has the ability to save animations either to a file, or directly to the LED controller (ESP32 and friends). 

Additionally, it supports multiple controllers on the same strip, meaning that it can drive very large amounts of LEDs very fast (~20,000 LEDs per second with 40 controllers and 2,000 LEDs).

## Usage

If you want to use this project, you will need a couple of things:
 - LEDs - anything that is supported by FastLED will work fine.
 - Any microcontroller supported by FastLED and PlatformIO. You may need a dual core controller depending on the number of LEDs and features that you want.  
 
Once you have the hardware, go to the [Wiki.](https://github.com/timothyhay256/Stochastic-volumetric-LED-display/wiki/Setting-up-LEDs)

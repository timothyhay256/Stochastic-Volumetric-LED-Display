# Volumetric LEDs (3D Mapped LEDs)
## This is the 
This is a bunch of code I use to map LEDs to 3d space, and use those mapped LEDs to make cool effects. And because you set their position in space by calibrating them, the LEDs can be in any abitrary positions. It currently takes about 1 hour to calibrate 150 LEDs when doing error correction by hand.

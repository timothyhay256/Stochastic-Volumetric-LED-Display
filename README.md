# Volumetric LEDs (3D Mapped LEDs)
## This is the Open Sauce Branch with the exact same code I used to exhibit at Open Sauce 2024 in it's completely un-clean, disorganized and messy glory. To use this project, it is strongly recommended to use the main branch. If the main branch also has this message, then I haven't gotten to cleaning up this code yet :)
*This is random but funny, the tempPos.json.kicked-out file contained the almost calibrated postitions of the LEDs when we got kicked out for the friday night party*  
This is a bunch of code I use to map LEDs to 3d space, and use those mapped LEDs to make cool effects. And because you set their position in space by calibrating them, the LEDs can be in any abitrary positions. It currently takes about 1 hour to calibrate 150 LEDs when doing error correction by hand.

*Most of this code was written in around a week, and school was taking most of my time, so don't expect good code quality*
